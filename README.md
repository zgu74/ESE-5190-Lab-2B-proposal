# What plan to build
    
We plan to build 4 LEDs connected in a cross shape. When the APDS 9960 detects the movement of our hands, the LED in the corresponding direction will be on, such as the left-side LED on as my hand moving left . Thatâ€™s so cool since we can control the device remotely in this way.

# Components requested

Four LEDs, one breadboard, four 360 ohm resistors, and several wires.
